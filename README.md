<h1 style="color:blue;">9 reasons to visit Guizhou, China's next big travel destination</h1>
<small> By Maggie Hiufu Wong</small>

<p>One of China's fastest-growing provinces, Guizhou has been steadily upgrading its offerings and is now one of the most promising travel destinations in the country.</p>


<p>From jaw-dropping superlative achievements to some of the most breathtaking scenery in China, here are nine reasons you should visit this southwest province before everybody else picks up on its allures.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Record-breaking caves</h2>

<p>Already a popular tourist destination, Shuanghe Cave in Guizhou's Suiyang County is set to welcome a new wave of visitors.</p>

<p>After decades of exploration, explorers confirmed in March that Shuanghe Cave, stretching 148 miles (238 kilometers) long, has claimed the title of Asia's longest cave -- a record previously held by Clearwater Cave in Sarawak, Malaysia.</p>

<p>The Shuanghe Cave Network is comprised of eight main caverns and more than 200 entrances.</p>



<h2 style="color:blue;">World's largest single-dish radio telescope</h2>


<p>With a diameter the size of 30 US football fields, China's <a href="http://www.cas.cn/zt/kjzt/fast/">Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST)</a> -- nicknamed the Eye of Heaven -- is the world's largest single-dish radio telescope.</p>

<p>While it wasn't built for the purpose of seeking extraterritorial life, FAST's uber sensitivity and size mean it'll likely be the site of Earth's first contact with aliens. In fact, <a href= "https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/21/health/china-fast-telescope-search-for-aliens/index.html">they're already searching for them.</a></p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Brewer of China's national liquor</h2>


<p>Moutai -- a colorless baijiu distilled from fermented sorghum -- is widely considered the de facto national liquor of China.</p>
<p>It's been the drink of choice at official banquets for decades -- Richard Nixon and Barack Obama are among the many guests who have been served Moutai by Chinese leaders during their visits.</p>
<p>Named after the town producing it in Guizhou, Moutai is particularly popular during Lunar New Year, when its normal market price lifts to about $200 per 500-milliliter bottle.</p>
